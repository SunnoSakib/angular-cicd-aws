# GitLab CI for angular+aws

# .gitlab-ci.yml

This repository includes a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which serves as the configuration file for GitLab CI/CD. The purpose of this file is to define the jobs and stages for continuous integration and deployment processes.

## Usage
To use this `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to the root directory of your GitLab repository.
2. Customize the file according to your specific project requirements and CI/CD workflows.

## Jobs and Stages
The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines different stages and jobs. Each job represents a specific task to be executed during the CI/CD process. Here is an overview of the predefined stages:

- **Build**: This stage is responsible for building the project, including compiling source code, running tests, and generating any necessary artifacts.
- **Test**: The test stage is used to execute various tests to ensure the correctness and stability of the project.
- **Deploy**: The deploy stage is responsible for deploying the project to the desired environment, such as a staging or production server.
- **Cleanup**: The cleanup stage is optional and can be used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks after the CI/CD pipeline has completed.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to fit your project's specific requirements. You can add or remove stages, jobs, and define the commands or scripts to be executed within each job.

Additionally, you may need to configure environment variables, define artifacts to be stored, set up notifications, or integrate with external services. These customizations can be done within the corresponding sections of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
